**TRO! Welcome to DESN399 Alt Web Design!**  
You're viewing the my course repository(repo). This serves as your reference and source for all course materials.  

**Important:** You'll copy this repository via template to create your own personal workspace. Think of it like this:  
- **This repo** = Course textbook (read-only, updated as needed)  
- **Your repok** = Your notebook (where you do all your work)  

**You're in the right place!** This is the DESN399 course repository maintained by me.  

**What happens next:**  
1. Make a copy of this repository (creating your own copy)  
2. Your copy becomes your personal workspace  
3. Each week, I may or may not add to my repo and have you copy contents over.  
4. By quarter’s end, your repo transforms into a portfolio  

👉 Ready to create your workspace? Click the green button labled **"Use this template"** in the top right! →
